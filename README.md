# Rowdy Raccoon

**Skeebo the Rowdy Raccoon is going feral!**

Mess with objects, scare away citizens, and talk to your bear friend to prove that you are the toughest raccoon in town. Try to figure out what Skeebo can do to earn points and look for bottle cap collectibles. Stay careful of Jenkins, the old man who hates raccoons and will not hesitate to shoot you. Try to complete the parkour!
